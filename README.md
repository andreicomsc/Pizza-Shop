# Pizza Shop Web app
The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with the Flask framework and understand its core concepts, including routing, template rendering with Jinja2, handling request and user input through forms, authentication, managing sessions, integrating front-end technologies, and backend with a simple database. Through this project, I explored the fundamentals of web development in Python, implemented user interaction features, and practiced deploying a web app in a development environment. This experience strengthened my ability to build scalable and modular web applications using Python-based frameworks.
